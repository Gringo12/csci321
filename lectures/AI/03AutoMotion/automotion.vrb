\frametitle{Smoothing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Occasionally bots appear to shudder.
\item Different steering takes place every other frame:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Toward object, away from obstacle, toward object, away from
    obstacle, ...
  \end{itemize}
\item Simple solution:  decouple bot heading from actual velocity.
\item Bot heading is average velocity of last few steps.
\end{itemize}
